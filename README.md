# Friendfinder - Built with Node.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS and jQuery 

![image](./readme/thumb.png)

To enhance my knowledge on Node.js together with Javascript, HTML and CSS, I created a Matchmaking friend-style app! 

## Getting Started :floppy_disk:

### Prerequisites :open_file_folder:
Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer! You can download it via the installer on the official site
```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```
Then either clone or download this repo.

The deployed version of this app is hosted on heroku [here](https://damp-refuge-32889.herokuapp.com/)

To view this app locally on your machine type `node server.js` into your terminal to intialize the app. This will set up a local server on your computer. Navigate to the server in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8080/`

To end the sever connection simply hold down `ctrl + c` inside of your terminal.
